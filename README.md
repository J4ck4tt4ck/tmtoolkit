## Requirements

### Required packages


### Optional packages

For LDA evaluation metric `griffiths_2004` it is necessary to install [gmpy2](https://github.com/aleaxit/gmpy) for multiple-precision arithmetic. This in turn requires installing some C header libraries for GMP, MPFR and MPC. On Debian/Ubuntu systems this is done with:  

```
sudo apt install libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev libmpc-dev
```

After that, gmpy2 can be installed via *pip*.
